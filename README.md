# MilfordFederal
A fine recreation of the MilfordFederal bank's iOS application in Java, showcasing OOP, interface implementation, object serialization, and more.

This personal project encompasses four class files, an interface, and a test program. The test program creates a UserAccount, which is then responsible for creating Alert, Transaction, and BankAccount objects under that user's account. This program tracks the number of accounts a user has, alerts on the app such as insufficient balance or incorrect password attempt, and every approved transaction. These objects are then stored in the milfordinformation.ser file, where they can be implemented on the next run of the program.
